		<section><h3>Pear Tree Incident</h3>

		  <p>There was a pear tree close to our own vineyard, heavily laden with fruit, which was not tempting either for its color or for its flavor.
</p>

		<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out"><h3>Pear Tree Incident</h3>
		  
		  <p>Late one night--having prolonged our games in the streets until then, as our bad habit was--a group of young scoundrels, and I among them, went to shake and rob this tree. We carried off a huge load of pears, not to eat ourselves, but to dump out to the hogs, after barely tasting some of them ourselves.</p>

		  <p>Doing this pleased us all the more because it was forbidden.</p>

		<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out"><h3>Pear Tree Incident</h3>


		  <p>Such was my heart, O God, such was my heart--which thou didst pity even in that bottomless pit. Behold, now let my heart confess to thee what it was seeking there, when I was being gratuitously wanton, having no inducement to evil but the evil itself.
</p>

		<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out"><h3>Pear Tree Incident</h3>
		  <p class="fragment">It was foul, and I loved it. I loved my own undoing. I loved my error–not that for which I erred but the error itself. A depraved soul, falling away from security in thee to destruction in itself, seeking nothing from the shameful deed but shame itself.</p>

		  <h3>Neo-Platonism</h3>
<p class="fragment">
  the first principle of reality is "the One", an utterly simple, ineffable, unknowable subsistence which is both the creative source and the teleological end of all existing things. </p>
		    <p class="fragment"> "the One", or "the God"</p>
		    <p class="fragment">
Evil: not an independent existence. Like darkness, which does not exist in itself but only as the absence of light.

<ul>

		    <li class="fragment">human free will?</li>

<h3>Evil</h3>
<p class="fragment">Creation is good</p>
<p class="fragment">"every nature, insofar as it is a nature, is good."</p>

<h3>Evil</h3>
<p> Fall in the Garden of Eden, the first human beings succumbed to temptation, and evil – the absence of good – entered the human spirit</p>
