## An implementation of Oblivious Transfer with Blind IBE


We use an Oblivious Transfer technique to implement an anonymous PerPerView service. Here, the anonymity is on the video content rather than the user identity. In other words, a user requests PayPerView service for a particular video. The server can verify the userâ€™s identity and payment information, the server then grants the service but does not know which video is being served.

This might have practical application for the next-generation video services. For example, with Netflix online video service, it can incorporate this anonymous PerPerView feature with the following setup. Netflix provides a set of popular videos to the user in a hard-drive or DVDs. The premium video contents are pre-encrypted. It also provides the video content guide to the user. The user has the data but cannot watch the videos unless they first pay Netflix.

Now, when the user would like to watch a particular video, say the i-th video. He uses the anonymous PayPerView system to request a service from Netflix. Netflix sends back the keying materials for the i-th video after verifying the user's payment. The user is now able to watch the video content after decryption. Netflix, however, does not know the value of i after this transaction. It does not know which video the user has requested. This provides user privacy.

### Oblivious Transfer

In an oblivious transfer, the sender (server) has a set of messages $$M_1, M_2, \cdots, M_n$$. The receiver(client) has an index $$i$$.
They interact in such a way that at the end the receiver obtains $$M_i$$ without learning anything on other messages and that the sender does not learn anything about $$i$$.

Our system is based on the paper from Green and Hohenberger [1].  We use a blind Identity-based Encryption with Boney-Boyen IBE [2]. 

Blind Extract protocol with Boneh-Boyen IBE scheme. See References for details.

### Project Setup:
The implementation is based on the Stanford pbc crypto library. Our implementation is in C++, with client server communicating through a socket. In a real implementation, the client server could use RPC (e.g, Facebook Thrift).

We use a program to generate the system parameters. This includes the group parameters, IBE system parameters.
We use 100 short text files to represents N video contents. We generate $$N (N=100)$$ random messages $$M_i$$ in group $$G_T$$. We use these messages as the keying materials for AES encryption of the text files. We make the AES encrypted files available to the client (user).
The client communicates with the server through a socket. The client pick $$i$$ and sends the calculated value $$h$$ to the server.
The server sends back the keying materials.
The client performs the decryption and recover the original message $$M_i$$, which is then used to decrypt the AES-encrypted data file.

Received keying materials from server. 
Now, decrypt the original text file : 
This is data file 89.

This simulates the video content data in the clear.
The data will be AES encrypted and the cipher text sent to 
the client. The encryption passphrase is in the
